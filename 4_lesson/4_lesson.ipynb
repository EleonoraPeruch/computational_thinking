    "# Data reconciliation\n",
    "Textual data in humanities can be messy, not clean and fuzzy. We may have data that are similar to data belonging to other sources, e.g. data about photographers, but slight differences between strings, due to different naming conventions prevent us to find a perfect match (e.g. 'Yvonne De Rosa', 'Y. De Rosa', 'De Rosa, Y.'). A good practice and a very common task is to reconcile data among data sources, in order to integrate and further process data. \n",
    "\n",
    "We'll use a pure-python approach to reconcile our data against an external source, but be aware that there are several technologies more easy-to-use, e.g. [Openrefine](http://openrefine.org/). \n",
    "\n",
    "## Authority files\n",
    "When reconciling data to an external source, the best practice is to refer to an authority file, i.e., a dataset, a vocabulary, or a thesaurus well-known and reused in a large community, that includes all the information required to identify an entity. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are several established authority files, e.g. [VIAF](https://viaf.org/) for reconciling data about people, or [geonames](http://www.geonames.org/) for place names. For the sake of simplicity, we'll use [DBPedia](http://wiki.dbpedia.org/), the dataset behind Wikipedia. We'll try fo find matches between names in our data, a local .csv file including names of italian photographers, and any entity we can find in DBPedia, by means of an algorithm for fuzzy string matching.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Querying APIs\n",
    "We'll use the [DBPedia lookup Service](http://wiki.dbpedia.org/projects/dbpedia-lookup), which is an [API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface) that accepts a keyword in a query string, and returns an XML document including a buch of [metadata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata) about the entity you searched (if found). \n",
    "\n",
    "Among this metadata, there is a URI that identifies the corresponding entity - that's the identifier we are looking for. \n",
    "\n",
    "E.g. we want to search \"Tina Modotti\" in DBPedia, an italian photographer whose name is included in our local file. To perform such a query we build a URI that starts with `http://lookup.dbpedia.org/api/search/KeywordSearch?MaxHits=1&QueryString=` and we add a string parameter in the end, `Tina Modotti` (we do not care about whitespaces, that are handled during the request to the API). The API returns a [XML file](http://lookup.dbpedia.org/api/search/KeywordSearch?MaxHits=1&QueryString=Tina%20Modotti), wherein the element <URI> contains `http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tina_Modotti`. \n",
    "\n",
    "To request a URI in Python, we built we use the library `requests`. It allows us to send a HTTP request, to manipulate data on the web and access its content.\n"
